                "I've traveled to many resorts around the world in search of the
                best fishing experience and eventually, I've found it. This is a
                PagleWaters Fishing Club & Resort. Besides the amazing beauty
                around you, their services are thoroughly thought-out. You can
                fish alone or with an instructor. I've experienced an incredible
                fishing with my family. Their chef has cooked the most delicious
                meals from the fish we caught every evening. Highly recommend
                this resort to everyone!"

                throughout our stay at this Resort. All the stay was extremely
                enjoyable and all our needs were fully satisfied. They provided
                5-star hospitality and the meals at the restaurant were just
                fantastic. The accommodation was clean and comfortable, with the
                amazing ocean view. Much thanks for the great time!”

                “PagleWaters Club & Resort fully exceeded my expectations in
                everything they did. The fishing was just fantastic and
                unforgettable thanks to Captain Jack. The meals at the
                restaurant were like masterpieces thanks to Chef Anthony. I am
                still feeling that special taste of the last seafood meal. All
                the team was very friendly, welcoming, and extremely attentive
                to each client. Thanks for a good rest and memorable fishing
                adventure! I will definitely come back!”
