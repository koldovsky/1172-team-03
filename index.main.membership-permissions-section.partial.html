          We allows our club members to go fishing and unwind whenever they like
          at no extra cost by only calling in advance to make a reservation. You
          can also fish with a rented lodge or camp at a small day fishing fee.
          The membership also gives members a 15% discount on any lodge rental
          when they want to stay for several days.
